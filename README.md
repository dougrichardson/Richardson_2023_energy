# Codes for generating results and figures

Notebooks are numbered in the order they should be run.

* Notebooks prefixed with a zero are used to prepare the data for analysis, e.g. extracting the relevant ERA5 data and computing regional averages.
* `1_energy_events.ipynb` contains the code for generating Fig. 1.
* `2_synoptics.ipynb` contains the code for generating Figs. 2 and S1.
* `3_modes.ipynb` contains the code for generating Figs 3, 4 and S2-S4.
